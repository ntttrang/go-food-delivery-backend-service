# Go Food Delivery Backend Service - Improvement Tasks

This document outlines a comprehensive list of tasks for improving the Go Food Delivery Backend Service, which is designed as a microservices architecture in a monorepo structure. Each module represents a separate microservice following Hexagonal Architecture principles.

## Architecture Improvements

### Microservices Structure

- [ ] **Separate Service Deployments**
  - Create individual Dockerfiles for each microservice (user, food, restaurant, category, media)
  - Implement a docker-compose.yml for local development with all required services (MySQL, Redis, MinIO)
  - Add Kubernetes manifests for production deployment with proper resource limits and health checks
  - Create deployment scripts that maintain environment-specific configurations

- [ ] **Service Discovery**
  - Implement a service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd) to replace the current environment variable-based service URLs
  - Add service registration on startup for each microservice
  - Create a client-side service discovery mechanism to dynamically resolve service endpoints
  - Add health check endpoints to each service with standardized response format
  - Implement circuit breakers for service-to-service communication

- [ ] **API Gateway**
  - Implement an API Gateway as the single entry point for external clients
  - Configure routing rules to direct requests to appropriate microservices
  - Add request authentication and authorization at the gateway level
  - Implement rate limiting and request throttling with configurable rules per endpoint
  - Add request logging and monitoring at the gateway level

### Hexagonal Architecture Refinements

  - Refactor each module to have a dedicated `/domain` package containing:
    - Pure domain models free from infrastructure dependencies (no GORM tags)
    - Domain services for complex business logic
    - Repository interfaces (ports) moved from infrastructure layer
  - Create domain events for important state changes (e.g., OrderCreated, UserRegistered)
